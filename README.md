AI & Computer Vision Driven 2D Level Generation from Hand-Drawn Sketches

This project transforms simple hand-drawn 2D map sketches into fully playable Unity levels using a combination of synthetic data generation, U-Net deep learning segmentation, and procedural prefab instantiation. The system takes a scanned sketch, interprets rooms and corridors, exports them as structured JSON coordinates, and reconstructs the level in Unity in real time.

📌 Overview
This project builds an end-to-end pipeline that:
Understands a hand-drawn map
Segments walls and structural elements using a U-Net CNN
Post-processes the mask and extracts wall-tile coordinates
Outputs a clean JSON representation of the map
Reconstructs a playable 2D level inside Unity using C#
The workflow allows any designer—even without technical experience—to simply draw a layout and get a functional game level in seconds.
✨ Features
AI & Vision
Synthetic dataset generation (1,000+ procedurally generated maps)

Achieves >90% IoU on hand-drawn test maps
Robust corridor reconstruction (even thin structures)
Level Generation
Pixel-perfect JSON export of wall coordinates
Real-time Unity reconstruction using prefab instantiation
Supports thousands of tiles with smooth performance (120+ FPS)
Instant sketch → level workflow (< 500 ms end-to-end on GPU)

🚀 Pipeline
1. Synthetic Data Generation
Generates random layouts (rooms + MST-based corridors)
Adds augmentations to mimic hand-drawn sketches
2. Deep Learning Segmentation
U-Net trained in PyTorch
Composite loss → better thin-structure detection
Achieved 0.92 IoU, 0.94 Precision, 0.90 Recall
3. Post-Processing
Otsu thresholding
Morphological closing
Pixel extraction into JSON array
4. Unity Level Instantiation
Reads JSON with MiniJSON
Instantiates 1×1 wall prefabs at grid coordinates
Produces a playable level with colliders, physics, and full navigation
📂 Unity Integration
Place your JSON map file into Resources/ and assign it to the MapLoader script:
public TextAsset mapFile;
public GameObject wallPrefab;
public float cellSize = 1f;
Run the scene → your level is instantly generated.
📊 Results Summary
IoU: 0.92
Precision: 0.94
Recall: 0.90
Corridor recovery: 88% for very thin structures
End-to-end speed: ~350 ms (including Unity load)
Maximum tiles instantiated: ~10,000 at 120+ FPS
More experimental details, diagrams, and figures are available in the full report.
⚠️ Limitations
Model expects orthogonal, rectilinear sketches
Curved / artistic drawings degrade segmentation
Strict JSON format required
Only supports 2D tile-based Unity levels
🔮 Future Improvements
Support for irregular / circular rooms
Smart preprocessing for variable pen thickness
Unity Editor plugin for drag-and-drop import
3D reconstruction using volumetric U-Nets
Interactive correction & reinforcement learning feedback loop
